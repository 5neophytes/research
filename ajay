An idea to optimize the calculation of carbon footprint score is to use a deep learning model which considers different external factors like weather, traffic etc and then gives the carbon footprint score.
This can help centralize the carbon footprint score across all states instead of storing the data for every state on cloud.
This can also help us inculcate deep learning in our project since the original project is turning out to be a little easier than earlier thought.
