What is the average annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of a typical passenger vehicle? A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of CO2 per year. This assumes the average gasoline vehicle on the road today has a fuel economy of about 22.2 miles per gallon and drives around 11,500 miles per year


CO2​ emissions (kg)=Fuel consumption (liters)×2.31

To get a comparable "carbon score" for trips of different durations, normalize the emissions by the trip duration:
Carbon Score=CO2 emissions (kg) / Trip Duration (hours)

Alternatively, normalize by distance:
Carbon Score=CO2 emissions (kg) / Distance (km)



Calculating the Carbon Footprint of a Car Trip:
- Fuel Efficiency: The primary factor in determining the carbon footprint of a car trip is the fuel efficiency of the vehicle. This can be measured in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers.
- Distance Traveled: The distance traveled is a key component as well, as it determines the amount of fuel consumed.
- Fuel Type: Different types of fuels have different carbon intensities. For example, gasoline and diesel have different carbon emissions per unit of energy.
- Emission Factor: Emission factors are used to convert fuel consumption into CO2 emissions. These factors are typically provided by government agencies or environmental organizations.
- Calculation: The carbon footprint of a car trip can be calculated by multiplying the distance traveled by the fuel consumption per unit distance and the emission factor for the specific fuel used.
