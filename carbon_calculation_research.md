What is the average annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of a typical passenger vehicle? A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of CO2 per year. This assumes the average gasoline vehicle on the road today has a fuel economy of about 22.2 miles per gallon and drives around 11,500 miles per year


CO2​ emissions (kg)=Fuel consumption (liters)×2.31

To get a comparable "carbon score" for trips of different durations, normalize the emissions by the trip duration:
Carbon Score=CO2 emissions (kg) / Trip Duration (hours)

Alternatively, normalize by distance:
Carbon Score=CO2 emissions (kg) / Distance (km)



Calculating the Carbon Footprint of a Car Trip:
- Fuel Efficiency: The primary factor in determining the carbon footprint of a car trip is the fuel efficiency of the vehicle. This can be measured in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers.
- Distance Traveled: The distance traveled is a key component as well, as it determines the amount of fuel consumed.
- Fuel Type: Different types of fuels have different carbon intensities. For example, gasoline and diesel have different carbon emissions per unit of energy.
- Emission Factor: Emission factors are used to convert fuel consumption into CO2 emissions. These factors are typically provided by government agencies or environmental organizations.
- Calculation: The carbon footprint of a car trip can be calculated by multiplying the distance traveled by the fuel consumption per unit distance and the emission factor for the specific fuel used.

- HOW TO BUILD A SCORE?????

- APPROACH 1: ON THE BASIS OF DISTANCE TRAVELLED
- Assume a trip with the following data:

    Fuel type: Petrol
    Fuel consumption: 5 liters

CO2 Emissions Calculation:
CO2 emissions=5 liters×2.31 kg CO2/liter=11.55 kg CO2

Define the Scale: Determine the minimum and maximum CO2 emissions values you expect for typical trips. For example, you might decide that the maximum emissions (100 on your scale) correspond to burning 10 liters of petrol (23.1 kg CO2), and the minimum emissions (0 on your scale) correspond to burning 1 liter of petrol (2.31 kg CO2).

BUT, THIS METHOD IS WRONG, BECAUSE WE DONT HAVE TO JUDGE THE SCORE ON THE BASIS OF DISTANCE TRAVELLED BY THE CAR, WE WANT TO JUDGE THE SCORE ON THE BASIS OF HOW WELL THE CAR WAS DRIVEN(TRAFFIC, DRIVINGSTYLE)


APPORACH 2: ON THE BASIS OF TIMESet the upper and lower bounds for CO2 emissions for a 30-minute trip. For example, let's assume:

    High emissions (100 on the scale): 20 kg CO2 (this might be equivalent to burning approximately 8.66 liters of petrol in 30 minutes, which is quite high).
    Low emissions (0 on the scale): 2 kg CO2 (this might be equivalent to burning approximately 0.87 liters of petrol in 30 minutes, which is quite low).


Adapting to Different Durations

If you want to generalize this for different trip durations, you could first normalize emissions by time:

Normalized CO2 emissions (kg CO2 per hour)=CO2 emissionsTrip Duration (hours)Normalized CO2​ emissions (kg CO2​ per hour)=Trip Duration (hours)CO2​ emissions​

Then, use the same approach with time-adjusted bounds.

This method allows you to create a consistent and meaningful scoring system based on trip duration, helping you compare the environmental impact of different trips more effectively.
