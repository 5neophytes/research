Vehicle Speed:Speed data can indicate whether the car is moving and at what rate. Fluctuations in speed can suggest changes in traffic conditions.
Engine RPM (Revolutions Per Minute):Engine RPM can provide insights into the engine's workload and how hard the car is working, which can vary in traffic conditions.
Throttle Position:The throttle position indicates how much the accelerator pedal is depressed. In stop-and-go traffic, there may be frequent changes in throttle position as the driver accelerates and brakes.
Engine Load:Engine load data shows how much stress the engine is under. In heavy traffic, the engine load may fluctuate as the driver accelerates, brakes, and idles.
Fuel Consumption:Monitoring fuel consumption can indicate whether the car is idling excessively or consuming more fuel due to stop-and-go driving conditions.
Engine Coolant Temperature:Elevated engine coolant temperatures may suggest that the car is stuck in traffic, as reduced airflow can lead to overheating in congested conditions.
Air Intake:This is similar to RPM
Vehicle Acceleration(Used for engine load):Acceleration data can show how the car is accelerating or decelerating, which can be indicative of traffic patterns.
Braking:Monitoring braking, which occurs frequently in stop-and-go traffic.
Transmission Gear Status:Gear status data can indicate whether the car is constantly shifting gears, which may occur in traffic due to frequent stops and starts.And which gear can determine traffic(eg: if usually 1 or 2 gear then traffic)
Vehicle Location(This is to be retrieved from maps, google maps is not the only option):Integrating GPS or location data with OBD parameters can help contextualize the car's behavior in specific traffic conditions or congestion-prone areas.
